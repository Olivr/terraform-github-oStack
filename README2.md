# _oStack_

[Git-based tech stack](https://ostack.io) for your startup integrating the concepts of Infrastructure-as-code, GitOps, DevOps and process automation ü§ù

_oStack_ drastically increases your time-to-market while being highly scalable in costs, performances, number of collaborators.

## Who should use it

‚úÖ If you're **working alone** on one or more side projects. _oStack_ can help you get started quickly and share your infrastructure costs between all your projects.

‚úÖ If you're **bootstrapping your startup**, _oStack_ provides a low cost yet highly scalable collaborative environment.

‚úÖ If you're **working in an enterprise**, _oStack_ enables, out of the box, transparency across developers, operations and infrastructure teams while preserving ownership. Everything is as-code and uses modules so it can be customized easily by writing code. We, the maintainers of this project, also provide professional services to customize it for you.

üü• If you are not comfortable with Git or even coding. Head to [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) or [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) instead.

üü• If you have no knowledge of the concepts of Infrastructure-as-code, GitOps, DevOps, you should check out [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for a simpler alternative.

## Main benefits

### Cost optimization

- You could start with one environment on a single-node cluster costing \$10 per month with Linode.
- Many open-source software offer an option to be deployed on a Docker or Kubernetes environment; having a cluster ready and in a versioned state can mean a lot when making decisions between self-hosted vs SaaS offerings.

### Flexibility

- _oStack_ is modular. For example you could use the module `kube-cluster-aws` instead of `kube-cluster-linode` and voil√†! (Please do create your own modules!)
- _oStack_ doesn't force you into a set of environments, clusters or projects. All you need need to get started is at least 1 cluster, 1 environment, 1 project.

### Scalability

- _oStack_ uses of _teams_ instead of _users_ so it just works from 1 to ‚àû collaborators. Because the whole stack is documented, it's also much easier to onboard new collaborators.
- _oStack_ uses the power of Kubernetes to enable infinite performance scalability for your applications.

## Usage

There are two ways to bootstrap _oStack_:

- Let [Oliv'r](https://olivr.com/?start=ostack) do it for FREE (**recommended**)
- Use the [initialization repo](https://github.com/olivr/ostack-adopt)
